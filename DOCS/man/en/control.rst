Interactive Control
===================

MPlayer has a fully configurable, command-driven control layer which allows you
to control MPlayer using keyboard, mouse, joystick or remote control (with
LIRC). The sections below describe the default bindings. Bindings can be
freely reconfigured in the input.conf configuration file.

Key input works in either video playback window or terminal window. Modifier
keys (Alt, Ctrl and Meta, plus Shift for combinations with non-printable
characters like Shift+RIGHT) may work only partially or not at all depending
on the platform and input method. For example, terminal input does not support
modifiers at all, while Linux video outputs using X support arbitrary modifier
combinations.
